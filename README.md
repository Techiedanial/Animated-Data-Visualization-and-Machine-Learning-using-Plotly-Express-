## Introduction
This project focuses on creating animated data visualizations using the Gapminder dataset.In addition to interactive visualizations, we integrate a machine learning model to predict future trends in life expectancy based on various factors such as Year, Population, and GDP per Capita.

The main goal of this project is to provide an in-depth understanding of global development metrics (such as life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population) across different countries and continents from 1952 to 2007.This visualization is made interactive using Plotly Express, allowing users to observe global trends over time.

We also incorporate a machine learning model to predict life expectancy based on historical data, adding predictive analytics to the project.

##  Features
#### Animated Interactive Visualizations:
-Visualizing life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population for each country, animated over the years.
-Filtering data by continent or specific years using interactive sliders.
#### Machine Learning Prediction:
-Predicting life expectancy using a linear regression model based on factors such as year, population, and GDP per capita.
-Evaluating the model using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for performance.
#### Correlation Heatmap:
-Visualizing the relationships between different variables (year, population, GDP per capita, and life expectancy) using a heatmap.

## Technologies used
#### Python: Used for data processing, modeling, and visualization.
#### Plotly Express: For creating interactive and animated visualizations.
#### Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
#### Scikit-learn: For implementing the machine learning model (Linear Regression).
#### Seaborn & Matplotlib: For visualizing the correlation heatmap.
#### Jupyter Notebook: For running and presenting the project in an interactive environment.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is the Gapminder dataset provided by Plotly.The dataset contains historical information on:

-Life Expectancy
-Population
-GDP per Capita
These indicators are tracked across different countries and continents from 1952 to 2007.

## How to Run the Project

Step-by-Step Guide:
1)Run the Notebook:
-Open the notebook in Jupyter and run each cell in sequence.
-The first few cells load the necessary libraries and data.

2)Data Visualization:
It will show how life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population evolved over time.

3)achine Learning (Life Expectancy Prediction):
The linear regression model is implemented in a separate section.
Run the code to train the model, make predictions, and evaluate the performance using RMSE.

4)Correlation Heatmap:
The heatmap will help in visualize relationships between variables such as population, GDP per capita, and life expectancy.
