# Animated-Data-Visualization-and-Machine-Learning-using-Plotly-Express-
Performed Animated Data Visualization using Plotly Express

## Introduction
This project focuses on creating animated data visualizations using the Gapminder dataset.In addition to interactive visualizations, we integrate a machine learning model to predict future trends in life expectancy based on various factors such as Year, Population, and GDP per Capita.

The main goal of this project is to provide an in-depth understanding of global development metrics (such as life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population) across different countries and continents from 1952 to 2007.This visualization is made interactive using Plotly Express, allowing users to observe global trends over time.

We also incorporate a machine learning model to predict life expectancy based on historical data, adding predictive analytics to the project.
